The page hosted on [github pages](https://forgoroe.github.io/twitch-live) should play nicely on any device.

## Motivation

This project was initially a [FreeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api), until I decided to make it into something that I would probably like and maybe even use more.

## Resources and APIs

- jQuery

- [Twitch Javascript SDK](https://github.com/justintv/twitch-js-sdk)
